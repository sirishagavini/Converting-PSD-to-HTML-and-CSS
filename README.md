# Converting-PSD-to-HTML-and-CSS
1. Create a PSD in Adobe PhotoShop or many PSD files can be found online. I have created one by myself in Adobe Photoshop. to get good experience create a PSD with multiple layers and add some images and aadd different types of data representation like ordered or unordered list.
2. converting PSD to HTML and CSS in a IDE, I have used NetBeans (it can be anything of your choice).
